Description
This repository contains a collection of reusable AWS CloudFormation templates and Terraform configurations designed to automate the creation and management of AWS infrastructure. The templates help streamline the provisioning of services such as VPCs, EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and IAM roles, making it easier to build and maintain AWS environments.

Getting Started
This section will guide you through the setup and usage of the AWS resources in this repository.

Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed and configured on your local machine:

AWS CLI (for CloudFormation deployment).
Terraform (for deploying using Terraform).
An AWS account with appropriate IAM permissions.
Git to clone the repository.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aws_resources.git
cd aws_resources
Configure AWS CLI with your credentials:

bash
Copy code
aws configure
You will need your AWS Access Key, Secret Key, region, and default output format.

Usage
Using CloudFormation Templates
Navigate to the templates directory where the CloudFormation templates are located:

bash
Copy code
cd templates
Deploy a specific CloudFormation template using the AWS CLI. For example, to deploy a VPC, run:

bash
Copy code
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name my-vpc --template-body file://vpc.yaml --parameters ParameterKey=VpcName,ParameterValue=myVpc
Check the status of the stack creation:

bash
Copy code
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name my-vpc
To delete the stack when no longer needed:

bash
Copy code
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name my-vpc
Using Terraform Configurations
Navigate to the terraform directory:

bash
Copy code
cd terraform
Initialize Terraform (this downloads the necessary provider plugins):

bash
Copy code
terraform init
Plan the infrastructure changes:

bash
Copy code
terraform plan
Apply the configuration to create the resources:

bash
Copy code
terraform apply
To clean up and destroy the resources:

bash
Copy code
terraform destroy
AWS Resources
This repository includes the following AWS resources:

VPC: A customizable Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with support for both public and private subnets.
EC2 Instances: Configurations for launching EC2 instances based on your requirements.
S3 Buckets: Highly secure S3 buckets with versioning, encryption, and lifecycle management enabled.
IAM Roles: Predefined IAM roles and policies to manage secure access to AWS services.
You can modify these templates or configurations to suit your specific AWS infrastructure needs. The templates are organized in the templates/ directory for CloudFormation and the terraform/ directory for Terraform.
